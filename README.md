# MATLAB-Code-Analyzer-Excel-Report
Generate an Excel spreadsheet of code analyzer messages for a file, to make it easy to track your work addressing the issues.

I wrote this for a friend who likes to use Excel to track the issues reported by the M-Lint code analyzer on her code. She explained that she would paste the M-Lint report into Microsfot Excel and check off each item as she fixed it.
This file automatically creates a Microsoft Excel file containing the contents of the M-Lint report. It's quite basic - you can run for a single file or all files in a directory. Let me know if you find this useful and if you'd like to see other features added ...

Enjoy, Steph!
